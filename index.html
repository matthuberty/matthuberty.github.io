            Want to make a BLT?  Here are the steps:  
            <ol>
                <li>Get some wheat bread out of your pantry</li>
                <li>Put two slices in your toaster and toast</li>
                <li>Get some bacon, lettuce, and tomato out of your refrigerator</li>
                <li>Microwave your bacon.  I prefer to microwave because, wrapped in paper towel, cooked bacon is leaner and delicious</li>
                <li>Slice your tomatoe</li>
                <li>Grab some thin slices of lettuce</li>
                <li>By now, your toast and bacon should be done cooking</li>
                <li>Slather some mayo on your toast.</li>
                <li>Assemble that baby and eat it!  Obviously, put the bacon, lettuce, and tomatoe on one slice of toast and close the sando.</li>
            </ol>
